                To conclude, we remark that even certain differences, the event are present at relative 
                similar moment during a match. We can also see a correlation between the number of tweets,
                their lenght and the presence (or not) of an event. However some event are still hard to
                predict and some match are quite messy in term of event (ex: GermanyBrazil74 or FranceGermany70). Also, a
                good indicator is the variantion of the presence of letters in the tweets. In fact, when their
                is an event, it's more probable to have a large number of differentes letters in the tweets.
                We can explain this in two point: 1 as we see, tweets are more likely to be longer when their
                is an event. 2 when their is an event, it's more probable to have supporter of both team that
                tweet, and so the number of different letters increase cuz of the different language 
                (ex: french = lot of 'E', english = lot of 'W' so if both combined, E and W will be with an hight
                variance).

                I will be interesting to see the data after a clearing of the tweets (NLP), as well as 
                sentiment anylisis // long tweets. An other interesting aspect would be to test
                differents predictions and calculate a likelihood of this prediction thx to the function on
                temporal aspect (like simulate if it'd be real). A last point i didn't explore enought 
                (i didn't had an idear more elaborate than smoothing) would be to create graph of the
                differentes features (with the time considerated only as a feature) and try to do
                some clustering to see if we can find some pattern in the data (the good point in this 
                would be to remove the constraint of the time, because we can see clearly that the time has
                an impact).
